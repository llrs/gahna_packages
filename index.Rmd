# About 

.left[**myself**

I'm [Lluís Revilla Sancho](https://llrs.dev), a bioinformatician working on a research center of a hospital. 
Three packages on repositories: [BioCor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BioCor/), [BaseSet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BaseSet) and [experDesign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=experDesign).  
I have reviewed some packages on [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) and informally at [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org). 
]

.center[**you**


- ... know how to use R and write functions.  
- ... are using [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  
- ... have not created a package.  
- ... are using a computer with the latest [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) installed.  
]

If you want to be sure run this code:

```r
if (!require("devtools", character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
if (!require("covr", character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("covr")
}
```

???

[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) is a package to help develop packages.
Currently many actions are done via [usethis](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis).
If you see something like `usethis::function` it means we call the `function` from usethis package.

.pull-right[
Modify the DESCRIPTION of your package. 

- Add a good title.
- Add a Description.
- Add yourself as an author.

```{r countdown2, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```

## Add R files

On the new package R console run:

```r
usethis::use_r("dog_functions")
```

It will create a `dog_functions.R` file inside the R folder (and it will open it).

![:scale 50% "GIF of hadly wickham saying just typing R code"](https://c.tenor.com/pnK2MIoEAccAAAAC/hadley-wickham.gif)
]

---

## Add R files

1. Only valid R code: functions, objects, environments that don't depend on previous code executed. 
2. If a function uses a function of an other package use `package::function`
    3. Add that package to the appropriate site on [Description](#description)
    4. add a `#' @importFrom package function` (See next slide)

```r
meow <- function() {
    message("meow")
}
```
```{r countdown2b, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```

---
name:namespace
## NAMESPACE

Import code of other packages and export code of your package:

```r
import(dplyr)
importFrom(methods, is)
export(meow)
```

--

If using roxygen2 you can use:

```r
#' @import dplyr
#' @importFrom methods is
is_meow <- function(x){
    methods(x, "meow")
}

#' @export # To make it available to others
meow <- function() {
    message("meow")
} 
```

Which will be written to the NAMESPACE file when [updating the documentation](#rd-files)

???
Important file!

---
name:readme
## Documentation

### README

First page people might read if on Github or on a computer.

```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd() # build_readme()
```

Example README:
```{r data-table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/data.table_README.png")
```

--

Modify README:

```{r countdown3, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```
 

---
name:rd-files

## Documentation

### Function documentation

.pull-left[
Using [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), example:

```r
#' Title
#'
#' Description
#' @param x 
#'
#' @return Values returned
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' a("hi")
a <- function(x) {
  print(x)
}
```

Convert this specials comments into *.Rd files with:
```r
document()

In Rstudio you can insert the skeleton with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> .
In Rstudio you can convert the special comments into documentation with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> .

--

.center[Write your own documentation]

```{r countdown4, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```



---
name: vignettes

## Documentation

### Vignettes

Long form of documentation, how multiple functions work together (It can use functions of other packages)

```r
usethis::use_vignette(name = "intro")
```

--

Write your own vignette:
- Fruits growing
- Dogs/cats exploring the house or the neighborhood
- A match of your sport
- ...

```{r countdown5, echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```


---
name: tests

## Tests

Make sure that what you think it happens it really stays that way:
Can be quite complicated

```r
use_testthat()
use_test("meow")
```

.pull-left[
Change from:

```r
test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})

```
]

.pull-right[

To (**If** you used the [meow function](#namespace)): 
```r
test_that("mewo works", {
  expect_message(meow(), "meow")
})
```

]



--
```{r countdown6, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```

---
name:licenses
## Licenses

If sharing the package what can people do with your package? 

- **Permissive** licenses: Code with a permissive license can be freely copied, modified, and published, and the only restriction is that the license must be preserved. 

- **Copyleft** licenses: if you publish modified versions or bundle with other code, the modified version or complete bundle must also be licensed with the same license.

```{r licenses, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_mit_license() # Permissive
usethis::use_gpl_license() # Copyleft
usethis::use_proprietary_license() # Own license
```

.right[<sup>[Source](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html)</sup>]

???

---
name: news

## NEWS

Sharing what changed between releases

```r
usethis::use_news_md()
```

The file has this structure:

```raw
 # dogs 0.0.0.9000

 * Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

```

Version of the package

Text describing changes on the packages. 
It is a good place to acknowledge minor contributions

???
Modify to explain the changes.
Good idea to use - (#issue, `@user`)

--

```{r countdown7, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 3, top = 0)
```

---
## Finishing and checking

Check if everything works well! It can take some time.

```r
check()
```

It should pass without Warnings or Errors. 
If not (most probable) fix the problems found 

???
Automatically runs the test and checks the package compilance with common quality standards

---

## That's all


.center[
![:scale 60% "That's all folks"](https://media.giphy.com/media/lD76yTC5zxZPG/giphy.gif)
]

---

## Developing your package

- [Modify or add](#r-files) more *.R files to the R folder
- [Add or change function's documentation](#rd-files) and [vignettes](#vignettes) and update it (`document()`)
- Check the package (`check()`)
- Repeat.

---
## Questions, doubts, comments?

- It is normal to not succeed on the first 5-10 attempts!!
- Search, ask whenever you need.

Thanks for following through it.

## Git

Set up git as a control version system. This allows to share on [GitHub](https://github.com).
To set it up use:

```{r git, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

???
Version controls helps you to modify code securely and interact with others (and receive their suggestions). 


---
# Advanced
## Github

Share the package on Github:

```{r github, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

Add checks

```{r github-action, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github_action_check_release()
```

Use the git panel of Rstudio to commit and push updates on the package. 

???

Having a package public on github can help on your CV and to get users. 

---
# Advanced
## Code coverage

Report how much of the package is tested.

```{r coverage, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_coverage()
```

It can be done offline on your computer `covr::report()` but usually also reported online. 

???
Aim to have high code coverage (above 75%). 
High code coverage prevents your users (and yourself) to push changes that do not work. 


---
# Advanced
## Pkgdown website

Now that the package is working and public, a website makes it easier for users to find documentation.

```{r pkgdown, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_pkgdown()
usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()
```

???

It is also great for publicity, so others can read and learn about your package without installing it.
