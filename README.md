# Workshop for Ghana R user group: building packages


The workshop is a slide with some material and pauses to go through the code. 
It says that it needs RStudio, but that is only to be able to take advantage of the multiple panels of the IDE, it can be followed outside it.

There are many references and links on the first slides and some comments on the presenter notes.
